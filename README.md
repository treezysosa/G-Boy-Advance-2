# G BOY ADVANCE 2 — 0.14.1

**120 new built-in hip-hop presets** cover Detroit, West Coast and Florida: 40 in each region, bringing the factory bank to **530 presets**. Use START and choose a Hip-Hop category, or search by region and instrument. Keys, bells, plucks, pads and original synthetic vox are joined by bass and whistle-like leads. The previous 410 preset IDs, host-program positions, tags and parameter arrays are retained.

**Five new skins** — Crimson Red, Emerald Green, Midnight Blue, Gold and Rose Pink — join Purple, Glacier Blue, Black, White and Spice Orange. Each newly loaded instance opens in a different colour from the last launch. Reopening that same window or switching presets keeps its colour. Use SELECT → NEW COLOUR ON LOAD to turn this off and save a fixed project skin. ROM Hacks remains beside master volume. Drop one `.sf2` file anywhere on the window to load its instruments, or use ROM Hacks → LOAD SF2. Loading and validation run on the existing background worker; invalid banks leave the working instrument in place.

The engine reuses exact repeated modulation/filter calculations across matching chord voices, lists active voices once per render segment and skips unused effect reads while retaining warm histories. Existing patch settings, full-rate modulation, polyphony limits and 16-sample latency are retained. The 650-scene comparison using all 530 current patches was byte-identical against version 0.13.1. Matched Windows notes/chords/retrigger profiles measured processing-time reductions ranging from 12.2% to 20.3% across one-, four- and eight-voice workload groups. These are native measurements on a shared runner, not FL Studio CPU percentages or physical-driver deadline guarantees.

**0.14.1 validation is in progress.** [Previous 0.14.0 Windows/Ubuntu run 39196086290](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39196086290) passed eight Ubuntu DSP suites and eleven Windows CTest suites, including 622,854 native DSP/preset checks, 546 Windows application checks (121 library and 55 SoundFont checks), ten skin/state snapshots, two actual-bundle test hosts, pluginval strictness 10, Steinberg 47/0 and six installer lifecycle checks. The synthetic FL-named test host is not FL Studio.

[Previous 0.14.0 Windows installer ZIP](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39196086290/artifacts/12162173204). Close FL Studio and standalone, extract into a new folder, run `G-Boy-Advance-2-Setup-x64.exe`, then reopen FL64. [Portable/manual installation](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39196086290/artifacts/12162158409) · [Source](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/tree/feature/launch-skins-sf2-drop-0141) · [Current behavior and validation](docs/RELEASE_0_14_1.md).

The licensing decision remains explicitly deferred by the owner; this is unsigned build preparation. Current-version real FL Studio/audio-device/DPI/listening and interactive-install acceptance remain pending.

Actual Phase 2 Windows JUCE component render at 1280×646 from [passing CI run 39007537286](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39007537286). All controls are native components with vector painting; no reference bitmap is used. Interactive Windows high-DPI and DAW testing remain pending.

## Build on Windows

Install Visual Studio 2022 with **Desktop development with C++**, a Windows SDK, CMake 3.24+, and Git. In PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone --branch feature/launch-skins-sf2-drop-0141 https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2.git
cd G-Boy-Advance-2
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build-windows.ps1
```

You can also use [Build and validate in GitHub Actions](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39096250046). Factory/vocal and retro audition files are separate test outputs and are never installed or loaded by the instrument.

The first local build downloads the pinned JUCE 8.0.6 source. For an offline build, supply an existing checkout:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DGBA_JUCE_PATH=C:/SDKs/JUCE-8.0.6
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
# Optional host validation (downloads the build-time pluginval tool):
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validate-windows.ps1
```

Additional Phase 10 checks (official SDK is a separate build-time tool):

```powershell
git clone --branch v3.7.12_build_20 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk.git Dependencies/vst3sdk
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validate-steinberg-windows.ps1
cmake -S . -B build -DGBA_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON
cmake --build build --config Release --target gba2-benchmark
./build/Release/gba2-benchmark.exe build/validation-logs/callback-profile.csv
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/package-windows.ps1 -Iscc 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Inno Setup 6/ISCC.exe'
# Clean disposable admin VM only; refuses existing product installations:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/test-installer-windows.ps1
```

The installer acceptance script uses the actual common VST3 folder and removes its test installation. Review the pending manual gates in [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).

Output:

- `build/GBoyAdvance2_artefacts/Release/VST3/G Boy Advance 2.vst3/` (copy the entire bundle)
- `build/GBoyAdvance2_artefacts/Release/Standalone/G Boy Advance 2.exe`

Close your DAW, copy the entire `.vst3` directory into `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`, reopen the DAW, and rescan plugins. The standalone requires selecting a working audio device and MIDI input in its settings. Manual tests in FL Studio, Ableton Live, REAPER, Cubase, and Studio One are pending.

## Implemented in source

- Eight engines: subtractive, FM, additive, mipmapped original wavetables, Karplus–Strong plucked strings, formant vocals, chiptune, and modal keys.
- Sine, harmonic-limited triangle, PolyBLEP saw / square / pulse, and noise; resonant low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and formant filters.
- Two ADSRs, two routable LFOs, vibrato, tremolo, velocity, 16-channel MIDI pitch bend / modulation / sustain, 1–32 voices, stealing, mono / legato, glide.
- Reverb, delay, chorus, phaser, flanger, saturation, distortion, bitcrusher, tape wow / flutter, low / high shelves, and stereo width.
- 530 original factory patches across 20 categories, explicit named-instrument, vocal and retro profiles, calibrated levels and stable program identities. Vocal patches are synthesized vowel-like timbres and contain no recorded voices or speech.
- Reference-based vector UI, playable keyboard, spring-return pitch wheel, functional D-pad, preview A / stop B, START browser, SELECT advanced editor, assignable A–D controls.
- Ten colour skins with nonrepeating launch colours or a fixed project choice; SoundFont drag and drop; host-visible parameters, project state, user preset Save As / import / export / rename / delete, favorites / recent patches, category search, tags, keyboard navigation.
- Windows CI, portable packaging and Inno Setup installer script, DSP and JUCE integration tests.

## Factory and user presets

Canonical library: [`Presets/factory.json`](Presets/factory.json). The compiled plugin embeds the same parameter values in `Source/FactoryData.h`; users do not need to install an external bank. Regenerate both with `python scripts/generate_presets.py`. Recipe changes require the offline calibration workflow in the preset-format document; no authoring files or audio renders are needed at runtime.

User patches: `%APPDATA%\Treezy Audio\G Boy Advance 2\Presets\*.gba2preset`. Favorites and recents: `library.json` in the parent directory. Every .gba2preset synthesis patch contains parameters and metadata only. SoundFont banks are imported separately through ROM Hacks. Use START → IMPORT to add external `.gba2preset` patches and EXPORT SOUND to share the current edited sound. Maize `.mse` banks are unsupported; only `.sf2` banks are supported in ROM Hacks; `.chl` support needs an identified source format and is not implemented. See [preset schema](docs/PRESET_FORMAT.md).

## Tests without JUCE

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-core -DGBA_BUILD_PLUGIN=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-core --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build-core --output-on-failure
```

Or, run all seven DSP suites with a C++20 compiler alone:

```sh
bash scripts/test-core.sh
```

To compile the original factory/effects suite separately:

```sh
mkdir -p build-core
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror -ISource Source/dsp/SynthEngine.cpp Source/dsp/Effects.cpp Tests/EngineTests.cpp Tests/AllocationTracker.cpp -o build-core/gba2-tests
cd build-core
./gba2-tests --render
```

`--render` optionally creates six synthesized demonstration WAVs as test output. These are never used by the instrument. Every test run writes `preset-validation.csv` with factory patch RMS / peak levels.

See [performance measurements](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for the additive-engine optimization and the optional benchmark target.

## Packaging and licensing

`python scripts/package-source.py` creates a complete source ZIP and checks that the Windows build script and GitHub workflow are included.

With Inno Setup 6 installed, run `scripts/package-windows.ps1` after a successful release build. This creates an unsigned Windows archive and installer under `dist/`. Release signing, listening review, the separate Steinberg VST3 validator, interactive installer checks, and DAW testing remain release gates. Pluginval strictness 10 has passed on Windows.

Engine 6 has a revised sound in 0.8.0, including existing chiptune patches; the Phase 7 formant revision remains. Saved parameters retain their IDs, but audio renders may differ.

Read [third-party and licensing notes](docs/LICENSING.md) before distribution. JUCE 8 is dual licensed under AGPLv3 and commercial terms; source availability by itself does not fulfill all license obligations. No Nintendo branding or artwork is bundled.
