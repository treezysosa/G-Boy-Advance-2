# G BOY ADVANCE 2

A C++20 / JUCE 8 instrument targeting Windows x64 VST3 and standalone, with eight synthesis engines and optional WAV/AIFF sample playback. The five-colour console interface uses native scalable controls. Factory sounds remain synthesis-only; the plugin runs offline.

**0.12.0 sample-playback candidate.** SELECT → SAMPLES loads a mono/stereo WAV or AIFF, chooses its original MIDI root note, enables a whole-file loop, and selects synthesis, sample or layered playback. Sample voices use the existing joint 1–32 voice budget, envelopes, filters, modulation, pitch bend, sustain, glide and effects. START Save As / Import / Export Sound and DAW project state embed the sample, avoiding a dependency on the original file. User samples are optional; the existing 410 synthesis patches, all 64 audio parameter IDs, plugin identity and five skins are retained.

The owner explicitly requested sample playback after the earlier synthesis-only specification. Maize `.mse` decoding is a separate unsupported bank format; no public compatible SDK/format was found in this session. `.chl` remains unidentified. WAV/AIFF loading does not imply either bank format is readable.

Local validation is in progress; Windows candidate validation and packages are pending. See [0.12.0 scope, limits and validation](docs/RELEASE_0_12.md). Licensing remains deferred by the owner and this is an unsigned candidate. The preceding [0.11.0 evidence](docs/RELEASE_0_11.md) is historical, not validation of this build.

Actual Phase 2 Windows JUCE component render at 1280×646 from [passing CI run 39007537286](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39007537286). All controls are native components with vector painting; no reference bitmap is used. Interactive Windows high-DPI and DAW testing remain pending.

## Build on Windows

Install Visual Studio 2022 with **Desktop development with C++**, a Windows SDK, CMake 3.24+, and Git. In PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone --branch feature/sample-playback-0120 https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2.git
cd G-Boy-Advance-2
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build-windows.ps1
```

You can also open [Build and validate in GitHub Actions](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/workflows/build.yml), choose **Run workflow**, and download the Windows artifact after the job succeeds. The workflow and Windows script are included in the corrected source upload. Version 0.10.1 passed all nine CTest suites, pluginval 1.0.4 strictness 10, the official Steinberg validator (47 tests), clean install/reinstall/uninstall and standalone launch checks in [run 39059534979](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39059534979). The original engine-switch CPU accumulation is fixed; measured case averages and p99 times fit the sampled budgets, with two isolated over-budget calls in the new modal/retro stress case. Factory/vocal and retro audition files remain separate test outputs and are never installed or loaded by the instrument. See PHASE_10_FINALIZATION.md for numerical audio comparison and remaining physical acceptance.

The first local build downloads the pinned JUCE 8.0.6 source. For an offline build, supply an existing checkout:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DGBA_JUCE_PATH=C:/SDKs/JUCE-8.0.6
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
# Optional host validation (downloads the build-time pluginval tool):
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validate-windows.ps1
```

Additional Phase 10 checks (official SDK is a separate build-time tool):

```powershell
git clone --branch v3.7.12_build_20 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk.git Dependencies/vst3sdk
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validate-steinberg-windows.ps1
cmake -S . -B build -DGBA_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON
cmake --build build --config Release --target gba2-benchmark
./build/Release/gba2-benchmark.exe build/validation-logs/callback-profile.csv
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/package-windows.ps1 -Iscc 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Inno Setup 6/ISCC.exe'
# Clean disposable admin VM only; refuses existing product installations:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/test-installer-windows.ps1
```

The installer acceptance script uses the actual common VST3 folder and removes its test installation. Review the pending manual gates in [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).

Output:

- `build/GBoyAdvance2_artefacts/Release/VST3/G Boy Advance 2.vst3/` (copy the entire bundle)
- `build/GBoyAdvance2_artefacts/Release/Standalone/G Boy Advance 2.exe`

Close your DAW, copy the entire `.vst3` directory into `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`, reopen the DAW, and rescan plugins. The standalone requires selecting a working audio device and MIDI input in its settings. Manual tests in FL Studio, Ableton Live, REAPER, Cubase, and Studio One are pending.

## Implemented in source

- Eight engines: subtractive, FM, additive, mipmapped original wavetables, Karplus–Strong plucked strings, formant vocals, chiptune, and modal keys.
- Sine, harmonic-limited triangle, PolyBLEP saw / square / pulse, and noise; resonant low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and formant filters.
- Two ADSRs, two routable LFOs, vibrato, tremolo, velocity, 16-channel MIDI pitch bend / modulation / sustain, 1–32 voices, stealing, mono / legato, glide.
- Reverb, delay, chorus, phaser, flanger, saturation, distortion, bitcrusher, tape wow / flutter, low / high shelves, and stereo width.
- 410 original factory patches across 17 categories, explicit named-instrument, vocal and retro profiles, calibrated levels and stable program identities. Vocal patches are synthesized vowel-like timbres and contain no recorded voices or speech.
- Reference-based vector UI, playable keyboard, spring-return pitch wheel, functional D-pad, preview A / stop B, START browser, SELECT advanced editor, assignable A–D controls.
- Five per-instance colour skins; host-visible parameters, project state, user preset Save As / import / export / rename / delete, favorites / recent patches, category search, tags, keyboard navigation.
- Windows CI, portable packaging and Inno Setup installer script, DSP and JUCE integration tests.

## Factory and user presets

Canonical library: [`Presets/factory.json`](Presets/factory.json). The compiled plugin embeds the same parameter values in `Source/FactoryData.h`; users do not need to install an external bank. Regenerate both with `python scripts/generate_presets.py`. Recipe changes require the offline calibration workflow in the preset-format document; no authoring files or audio renders are needed at runtime.

User patches: `%APPDATA%\Treezy Audio\G Boy Advance 2\Presets\*.gba2preset`. Favorites and recents: `library.json` in the parent directory. Every patch contains parameters and metadata only. Use START → IMPORT to add external `.gba2preset` patches and EXPORT SOUND to share the current edited sound. WAV/AIFF samples are loaded in SELECT → SAMPLES. Maize `.mse` and unidentified `.chl` bank decoding are not implemented. See [preset schema](docs/PRESET_FORMAT.md).

## Tests without JUCE

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-core -DGBA_BUILD_PLUGIN=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-core --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build-core --output-on-failure
```

Or, run all seven DSP suites with a C++20 compiler alone:

```sh
bash scripts/test-core.sh
```

To compile the original factory/effects suite separately:

```sh
mkdir -p build-core
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror -ISource Source/dsp/SynthEngine.cpp Source/dsp/Effects.cpp Tests/EngineTests.cpp Tests/AllocationTracker.cpp -o build-core/gba2-tests
cd build-core
./gba2-tests --render
```

`--render` optionally creates six synthesized demonstration WAVs as test output. These are never used by the instrument. Every test run writes `preset-validation.csv` with factory patch RMS / peak levels.

See [performance measurements](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for the additive-engine optimization and the optional benchmark target.

## Packaging and licensing

`python scripts/package-source.py` creates a complete source ZIP and checks that the Windows build script and GitHub workflow are included.

With Inno Setup 6 installed, run `scripts/package-windows.ps1` after a successful release build. This creates an unsigned Windows archive and installer under `dist/`. Release signing, listening review, the separate Steinberg VST3 validator, interactive installer checks, and DAW testing remain release gates. Pluginval strictness 10 has passed on Windows.

Engine 6 has a revised sound in 0.8.0, including existing chiptune patches; the Phase 7 formant revision remains. Saved parameters retain their IDs, but audio renders may differ.

Read [third-party and licensing notes](docs/LICENSING.md) before distribution. JUCE 8 is dual licensed under AGPLv3 and commercial terms; source availability by itself does not fulfill all license obligations. No Nintendo branding or artwork is bundled.
