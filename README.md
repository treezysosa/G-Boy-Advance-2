# G BOY ADVANCE 2 — 0.13.0

Native Windows x64 VST3 and standalone hybrid synthesizer with optional **ROM Hacks SoundFont 2 playback**. Press the cartridge-shaped ROM Hacks button (or F3), choose LOAD SF2, select an instrument from the bank, and play MIDI or the on-screen piano. The normal 410 factory sounds still use synthesis. Five skins, 64 parameter IDs and the existing optimized synthesis engine are retained.

SoundFonts are copied into the application-data SoundFonts folder; DAW state saves the bank reference and instrument. Back up that folder with projects. Missing banks are reported visibly and stay silent until loaded again. General WAV/AIFF import remains unavailable. No game ROM or third-party SoundFont/audio is bundled. TinySoundFont is pinned and included under MIT terms.

[Windows/Ubuntu run 39188459523](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39188459523) passed eleven Windows CTest suites: 620,993 native DSP/preset checks (612,986 SoundFont checks plus 8,007 existing), 453 application checks including 55 SoundFont and 103 library checks, 265/266 actual-bundle synthetic-host checks, pluginval strictness 10, Steinberg 47/0 and six installer lifecycle checks. The FL-named host harness is not FL Studio.

[Download the tested Windows installer ZIP](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39188459523/artifacts/12158923159). Close FL Studio and the standalone app, extract it into a new folder, run `G-Boy-Advance-2-Setup-x64.exe`, then open FL64. Press ROM Hacks → LOAD SF2 → select an instrument. [Portable/manual installation](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39188459523/artifacts/12158658811) · [Source](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/tree/feature/rom-hacks-sf2-0130) · [Behavior, evidence and limits](docs/RELEASE_0_13.md).

The licensing decision remains explicitly deferred by the owner; this is unsigned build preparation. Current-version real FL Studio/audio-device/DPI/listening and interactive-install acceptance remain pending.

![G Boy Advance 2 Phase 2 native JUCE editor](docs/images/phase2-main.png)

Actual Phase 2 Windows JUCE component render at 1280×646 from [passing CI run 39007537286](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39007537286). All controls are native components with vector painting; no reference bitmap is used. Interactive Windows high-DPI and DAW testing remain pending.

## Build on Windows

Install Visual Studio 2022 with **Desktop development with C++**, a Windows SDK, CMake 3.24+, and Git. In PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone --branch feature/rom-hacks-sf2-0130 https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2.git
cd G-Boy-Advance-2
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build-windows.ps1
```

You can also use [Build and validate in GitHub Actions](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39096250046). Factory/vocal and retro audition files are separate test outputs and are never installed or loaded by the instrument.

The first local build downloads the pinned JUCE 8.0.6 source. For an offline build, supply an existing checkout:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DGBA_JUCE_PATH=C:/SDKs/JUCE-8.0.6
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
# Optional host validation (downloads the build-time pluginval tool):
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validate-windows.ps1
```

Additional Phase 10 checks (official SDK is a separate build-time tool):

```powershell
git clone --branch v3.7.12_build_20 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk.git Dependencies/vst3sdk
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validate-steinberg-windows.ps1
cmake -S . -B build -DGBA_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON
cmake --build build --config Release --target gba2-benchmark
./build/Release/gba2-benchmark.exe build/validation-logs/callback-profile.csv
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/package-windows.ps1 -Iscc 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Inno Setup 6/ISCC.exe'
# Clean disposable admin VM only; refuses existing product installations:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/test-installer-windows.ps1
```

The installer acceptance script uses the actual common VST3 folder and removes its test installation. Review the pending manual gates in [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).

Output:

- `build/GBoyAdvance2_artefacts/Release/VST3/G Boy Advance 2.vst3/` (copy the entire bundle)
- `build/GBoyAdvance2_artefacts/Release/Standalone/G Boy Advance 2.exe`

Close your DAW, copy the entire `.vst3` directory into `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`, reopen the DAW, and rescan plugins. The standalone requires selecting a working audio device and MIDI input in its settings. Manual tests in FL Studio, Ableton Live, REAPER, Cubase, and Studio One are pending.

## Implemented in source

- Eight engines: subtractive, FM, additive, mipmapped original wavetables, Karplus–Strong plucked strings, formant vocals, chiptune, and modal keys.
- Sine, harmonic-limited triangle, PolyBLEP saw / square / pulse, and noise; resonant low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and formant filters.
- Two ADSRs, two routable LFOs, vibrato, tremolo, velocity, 16-channel MIDI pitch bend / modulation / sustain, 1–32 voices, stealing, mono / legato, glide.
- Reverb, delay, chorus, phaser, flanger, saturation, distortion, bitcrusher, tape wow / flutter, low / high shelves, and stereo width.
- 410 original factory patches across 17 categories, explicit named-instrument, vocal and retro profiles, calibrated levels and stable program identities. Vocal patches are synthesized vowel-like timbres and contain no recorded voices or speech.
- Reference-based vector UI, playable keyboard, spring-return pitch wheel, functional D-pad, preview A / stop B, START browser, SELECT advanced editor, assignable A–D controls.
- Five per-instance colour skins; host-visible parameters, project state, user preset Save As / import / export / rename / delete, favorites / recent patches, category search, tags, keyboard navigation.
- Windows CI, portable packaging and Inno Setup installer script, DSP and JUCE integration tests.

## Factory and user presets

Canonical library: [`Presets/factory.json`](Presets/factory.json). The compiled plugin embeds the same parameter values in `Source/FactoryData.h`; users do not need to install an external bank. Regenerate both with `python scripts/generate_presets.py`. Recipe changes require the offline calibration workflow in the preset-format document; no authoring files or audio renders are needed at runtime.

User patches: `%APPDATA%\Treezy Audio\G Boy Advance 2\Presets\*.gba2preset`. Favorites and recents: `library.json` in the parent directory. Every .gba2preset synthesis patch contains parameters and metadata only. SoundFont banks are imported separately through ROM Hacks. Use START → IMPORT to add external `.gba2preset` patches and EXPORT SOUND to share the current edited sound. Maize `.mse` banks are unsupported; only `.sf2` banks are supported in ROM Hacks; `.chl` support needs an identified source format and is not implemented. See [preset schema](docs/PRESET_FORMAT.md).

## Tests without JUCE

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-core -DGBA_BUILD_PLUGIN=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-core --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build-core --output-on-failure
```

Or, run all seven DSP suites with a C++20 compiler alone:

```sh
bash scripts/test-core.sh
```

To compile the original factory/effects suite separately:

```sh
mkdir -p build-core
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror -ISource Source/dsp/SynthEngine.cpp Source/dsp/Effects.cpp Tests/EngineTests.cpp Tests/AllocationTracker.cpp -o build-core/gba2-tests
cd build-core
./gba2-tests --render
```

`--render` optionally creates six synthesized demonstration WAVs as test output. These are never used by the instrument. Every test run writes `preset-validation.csv` with factory patch RMS / peak levels.

See [performance measurements](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for the additive-engine optimization and the optional benchmark target.

## Packaging and licensing

`python scripts/package-source.py` creates a complete source ZIP and checks that the Windows build script and GitHub workflow are included.

With Inno Setup 6 installed, run `scripts/package-windows.ps1` after a successful release build. This creates an unsigned Windows archive and installer under `dist/`. Release signing, listening review, the separate Steinberg VST3 validator, interactive installer checks, and DAW testing remain release gates. Pluginval strictness 10 has passed on Windows.

Engine 6 has a revised sound in 0.8.0, including existing chiptune patches; the Phase 7 formant revision remains. Saved parameters retain their IDs, but audio renders may differ.

Read [third-party and licensing notes](docs/LICENSING.md) before distribution. JUCE 8 is dual licensed under AGPLv3 and commercial terms; source availability by itself does not fulfill all license obligations. No Nintendo branding or artwork is bundled.
