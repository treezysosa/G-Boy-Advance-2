# G BOY ADVANCE 2 — 0.15.0

**Twenty UI skins:** the ten new colours are Arctic Cyan, Atomic Violet, Graphite Grey, Ice Mint, Cobalt Blue, Sunset Copper, Pearl Lavender, Candy Coral, Forest Green and Lemon Yellow. Choose SELECT → SKIN, or keep NEW COLOUR ON LOAD enabled for a different colour at each launch. Existing skin IDs and fixed project colours remain compatible.

**530 factory presets, audited across the full bank.** The new gain-independent comparison uses three identical MIDI notes, two velocities, dry and wet synthesis, two spectral windows and held/release envelopes for every preset: 6,360 renders and 140,185 pairs. Eighteen closely related patches receive original synthesis/envelope revisions, recorded in `Presets/diversity-refinements.json`. Factory IDs, names and host ordering are unchanged. Saved projects and user presets keep their explicit sound settings. The Detroit, West Coast and Florida categories each contain forty presets.

**Further CPU work:** polyphase oversampling avoids known-zero interpolation taps and discarded decimator outputs, retaining nonlinear processing, warm histories and 16-frame latency. Wavetable mip tuning, plucked-string delay compensation, shared chord pitch exponentials and choir normalization are reused only while their exact inputs match. Voice limits, modulation rates and audio quality settings remain unchanged. Numerical audio and matched CPU comparisons use the immutable 0.14.1 DSP with identical current factory arrays. See [0.15.0 evidence](docs/RELEASE_0_15.md), [performance](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) and [factory audit](docs/FACTORY_LIBRARY.md) for measured results and limits.

ROM Hacks remains beside master volume, with single-file SF2 drag and drop, default/custom SoundFont folder, bank/instrument lists and last-bank recall. Saved projects take precedence over the startup bank. No SoundFonts or recorded audio are bundled.

[Builds and installer artifacts](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions?query=branch%3Afeature%2Fskins-diversity-cpu-0150) · [Source](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/tree/feature/skins-diversity-cpu-0150). Close FL Studio and standalone, extract the installer ZIP into a new folder, run `G-Boy-Advance-2-Setup-x64.exe`, then reopen FL64. User presets, banks and SoundFont preferences are retained by the installer.

These prepared builds are unsigned; the owner has deferred the licensing decision. Automated native-host validation does not substitute for actual FL Studio, physical audio-device, DPI or human listening acceptance.

Actual Phase 2 Windows JUCE component render at 1280×646 from [passing CI run 39007537286](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/runs/39007537286). All controls are native components with vector painting; no reference bitmap is used. Interactive Windows high-DPI and DAW testing remain pending.

## Build on Windows

Install Visual Studio 2022 with **Desktop development with C++**, a Windows SDK, CMake 3.24+, and Git. In PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone --branch feature/skins-diversity-cpu-0150 https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2.git
cd G-Boy-Advance-2
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build-windows.ps1
```

You can also use [Build and validate in GitHub Actions](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions?query=branch%3Afeature%2Fskins-diversity-cpu-0150). Factory/vocal and retro audition files are separate test outputs and are never installed or loaded by the instrument.

The first local build downloads the pinned JUCE 8.0.6 source. For an offline build, supply an existing checkout:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DGBA_JUCE_PATH=C:/SDKs/JUCE-8.0.6
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
# Optional host validation (downloads the build-time pluginval tool):
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validate-windows.ps1
```

Additional Phase 10 checks (official SDK is a separate build-time tool):

```powershell
git clone --branch v3.7.12_build_20 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk.git Dependencies/vst3sdk
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validate-steinberg-windows.ps1
cmake -S . -B build -DGBA_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON
cmake --build build --config Release --target gba2-benchmark
./build/Release/gba2-benchmark.exe build/validation-logs/callback-profile.csv
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/package-windows.ps1 -Iscc 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Inno Setup 6/ISCC.exe'
# Clean disposable admin VM only; refuses existing product installations:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/test-installer-windows.ps1
```

The installer acceptance script uses the actual common VST3 folder and removes its test installation. Review the pending manual gates in [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).

Output:

- `build/GBoyAdvance2_artefacts/Release/VST3/G Boy Advance 2.vst3/` (copy the entire bundle)
- `build/GBoyAdvance2_artefacts/Release/Standalone/G Boy Advance 2.exe`

Close your DAW, copy the entire `.vst3` directory into `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`, reopen the DAW, and rescan plugins. The standalone requires selecting a working audio device and MIDI input in its settings. Manual tests in FL Studio, Ableton Live, REAPER, Cubase, and Studio One are pending.

## Implemented in source

- Eight engines: subtractive, FM, additive, mipmapped original wavetables, Karplus–Strong plucked strings, formant vocals, chiptune, and modal keys.
- Sine, harmonic-limited triangle, PolyBLEP saw / square / pulse, and noise; resonant low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and formant filters.
- Two ADSRs, two routable LFOs, vibrato, tremolo, velocity, 16-channel MIDI pitch bend / modulation / sustain, 1–32 voices, stealing, mono / legato, glide.
- Reverb, delay, chorus, phaser, flanger, saturation, distortion, bitcrusher, tape wow / flutter, low / high shelves, and stereo width.
- 530 original factory patches across 20 categories, explicit named-instrument, vocal and retro profiles, calibrated levels and stable program identities. Vocal patches are synthesized vowel-like timbres and contain no recorded voices or speech.
- Reference-based vector UI, playable keyboard, spring-return pitch wheel, functional D-pad, preview A / stop B, START browser, SELECT advanced editor, assignable A–D controls.
- Twenty colour skins with nonrepeating launch colours or a fixed project choice; SoundFont drag and drop; host-visible parameters, project state, user preset Save As / import / export / rename / delete, favorites / recent patches, category search, tags, keyboard navigation.
- Windows CI, portable packaging and Inno Setup installer script, DSP and JUCE integration tests.

## Factory and user presets

Canonical library: [`Presets/factory.json`](Presets/factory.json). The compiled plugin embeds the same parameter values in `Source/FactoryData.h`; users do not need to install an external bank. Regenerate both with `python scripts/generate_presets.py`. Recipe changes require the offline calibration workflow in the preset-format document; no authoring files or audio renders are needed at runtime.

User patches: `%APPDATA%\Treezy Audio\G Boy Advance 2\Presets\*.gba2preset`. Favorites and recents: `library.json` in the parent directory. Every .gba2preset synthesis patch contains parameters and metadata only. SoundFont banks are imported separately through ROM Hacks. Use START → IMPORT to add external `.gba2preset` patches and EXPORT SOUND to share the current edited sound. Maize `.mse` banks are unsupported; only `.sf2` banks are supported in ROM Hacks; `.chl` support needs an identified source format and is not implemented. See [preset schema](docs/PRESET_FORMAT.md).

## Tests without JUCE

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-core -DGBA_BUILD_PLUGIN=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-core --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build-core --output-on-failure
```

Or, run all seven DSP suites with a C++20 compiler alone:

```sh
bash scripts/test-core.sh
```

To compile the original factory/effects suite separately:

```sh
mkdir -p build-core
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror -ISource Source/dsp/SynthEngine.cpp Source/dsp/Effects.cpp Tests/EngineTests.cpp Tests/AllocationTracker.cpp -o build-core/gba2-tests
cd build-core
./gba2-tests --render
```

`--render` optionally creates six synthesized demonstration WAVs as test output. These are never used by the instrument. Every test run writes `preset-validation.csv` with factory patch RMS / peak levels.

See [performance measurements](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for the additive-engine optimization and the optional benchmark target.

## Packaging and licensing

`python scripts/package-source.py` creates a complete source ZIP and checks that the Windows build script and GitHub workflow are included.

With Inno Setup 6 installed, run `scripts/package-windows.ps1` after a successful release build. This creates an unsigned Windows archive and installer under `dist/`. Release signing, listening review, the separate Steinberg VST3 validator, interactive installer checks, and DAW testing remain release gates. Pluginval strictness 10 has passed on Windows.

Engine 6 has a revised sound in 0.8.0, including existing chiptune patches; the Phase 7 formant revision remains. Saved parameters retain their IDs, but audio renders may differ.

Read [third-party and licensing notes](docs/LICENSING.md) before distribution. JUCE 8 is dual licensed under AGPLv3 and commercial terms; source availability by itself does not fulfill all license obligations. No Nintendo branding or artwork is bundled.
