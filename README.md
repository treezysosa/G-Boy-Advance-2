# G BOY ADVANCE 2

A C++20 / JUCE 8 hybrid synthesis instrument targeting Windows x64 VST3 and standalone. The purple, wide console interface uses native scalable controls. All sound is generated mathematically: there is no sampler, sample import, commercial game audio, or network dependency at runtime.

**Development build 0.1.1 — Windows release validation is pending.** The native DSP passes 1,387 checks; the compiled and linked JUCE test executable passes 112 integration checks on Linux. Project state, user presets, the on-screen keyboard connection, preview buttons, D-pad navigation, macro reassignment, and editor resizing have been exercised. Windows VST3/standalone compilation and DAW loading still need verification. See [validation status](docs/VALIDATION.md) and [exact next steps](docs/NEXT_STEPS.md).

Actual native JUCE component rendering on Linux at 1920×969. Windows font rendering and high-DPI behavior remain to be checked.

## Build on Windows

Install Visual Studio 2022 with **Desktop development with C++**, a Windows SDK, CMake 3.24+, and Git. In PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2.git
cd G-Boy-Advance-2
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build-windows.ps1
```

You can also open [Build and validate in GitHub Actions](https://github.com/treezysosa/G-Boy-Advance-2/actions/workflows/build.yml), choose **Run workflow**, and download the Windows artifact after the job succeeds. The workflow and Windows script are included in the corrected source upload; Windows build results still need verification.

The first local build downloads the pinned JUCE 8.0.6 source. For an offline build, supply an existing checkout:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DGBA_JUCE_PATH=C:/SDKs/JUCE-8.0.6
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

Output:

- `build/GBoyAdvance2_artefacts/Release/VST3/G Boy Advance 2.vst3/` (copy the entire bundle)
- `build/GBoyAdvance2_artefacts/Release/Standalone/G Boy Advance 2.exe`

Close your DAW, copy the entire `.vst3` directory into `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`, reopen the DAW, and rescan plugins. The standalone requires selecting a working audio device and MIDI input in its settings. Manual tests in FL Studio, Ableton Live, REAPER, Cubase, and Studio One are pending.

## Implemented in source

- Eight engines: subtractive, FM, additive, mipmapped original wavetables, Karplus–Strong plucked strings, formant vocals, chiptune, and modal keys.
- Sine, harmonic-limited triangle, PolyBLEP saw / square / pulse, and noise; resonant low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and formant filters.
- Two ADSRs, two routable LFOs, vibrato, tremolo, velocity, 16-channel MIDI pitch bend / modulation / sustain, 1–32 voices, stealing, mono / legato, glide.
- Reverb, delay, chorus, phaser, flanger, saturation, distortion, bitcrusher, tape wow / flutter, low / high shelves, and stereo width.
- 382 original factory patches across 17 categories. Vocal patches are synthesized vowel-like timbres and contain no recorded voices or speech.
- Reference-based vector UI, playable keyboard, spring-return pitch wheel, functional D-pad, preview A / stop B, START browser, SELECT advanced editor, assignable A–D controls.
- Host-visible parameters, project state, user preset Save As / rename / delete, favorites / recent patches, category search, tags, keyboard navigation.
- Windows CI, portable packaging and Inno Setup installer script, DSP and JUCE integration tests.

## Factory and user presets

Canonical library: [`Presets/factory.json`](Presets/factory.json). The compiled plugin embeds the same parameter values in `Source/FactoryData.h`; users do not need to install an external bank. Regenerate both with `python scripts/generate_presets.py`.

User patches: `%APPDATA%\Treezy Audio\G Boy Advance 2\Presets\*.gba2preset`. Favorites and recents: `library.json` in the parent directory. Every patch contains parameters and metadata only. See [preset schema](docs/PRESET_FORMAT.md).

## Tests without JUCE

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-core -DGBA_BUILD_PLUGIN=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-core --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build-core --output-on-failure
```

Or, with a C++20 compiler alone:

```sh
mkdir -p build-core
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror -ISource Source/dsp/SynthEngine.cpp Tests/EngineTests.cpp Tests/AllocationTracker.cpp -o build-core/gba2-tests
cd build-core
./gba2-tests --render
```

`--render` optionally creates six synthesized demonstration WAVs as test output. These are never used by the instrument. Every test run writes `preset-validation.csv` with factory patch RMS / peak levels.

See [performance measurements](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for the additive-engine optimization and the optional benchmark target.

## Packaging and licensing

`python scripts/package-source.py` creates a complete source ZIP and checks that the Windows build script and GitHub workflow are included.

With Inno Setup 6 installed, run `scripts/package-windows.ps1` after a successful release build. This creates an unsigned Windows archive and installer under `dist/`. Release signing, listening review, pluginval / VST3 validation, and DAW testing remain release gates.

Read [third-party and licensing notes](docs/LICENSING.md) before distribution. JUCE 8 is dual licensed under AGPLv3 and commercial terms; source availability by itself does not fulfill all license obligations. No Nintendo branding or artwork is bundled.
